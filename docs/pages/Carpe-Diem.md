## Contemplating the Future

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

Similarly, when contemplating and living in the future, all you'll find is anxiety!

## Living in The Past

When you live today, you'll find happiness!

But, when you go living in the past, you'll only find depression.

## Living in The Moment

Therefore, live today ... in the moment.

## Epilogue

Still, even given that ... always remember this!

Tomorrow will only take care of tomorrow if you plan for your future today, in the now.

What's past is past.

Seize the moment of this moment, seize the entire moments of this day!

Do so, and you'll find ...

That you've indeed enjoyed your very foreseeable future, as well as remembered your exceptionally fond past!
