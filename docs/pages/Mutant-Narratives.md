## The Battle of The Political Narrative

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

A false narrative can lead to a common psychosis called `Paranoid Personality Disorder` or **PPD**.

**PPD**, in turn, will undermine economic decision making, risk taking, and consumption.

So, what exactly is a `Political Narrative`?

Narratives are human constructs mixed with equal parts fact, emotion, and extraneous detail that can be weaved into a human interest story.

The resultant story can then be easily understood and translated by the common consumer of goods and services such that an indelible impression is stamped onto the human mind of the listener.

To relieve the anxiety and burden of this new understanding, the narrative is then transferred and shared among group members thus moving the impact zone from one member of the tribe to another.

## Flashback: 1920 - 1921

In 1920 - 1921, during the period of the "forgotten" flash economic depression in the United States that corresponded with the incoming administration of Warren G Hardig, consumers clammed way up to the point of boycott due to the perceived post World War I exorbitant prices that were then being offered for both goods and services across the board.

Therefore, in want and wait for lower prices, consumers and businesses in general postponed the purchase of discretionary items thus bringing on the flash economic depression that wiped out many a fledgling wealth at the time.

As a result, suicides, bankruptcies, and gloom kicked up socially, as well.

After the flash economic depression of 1920 - 1921 finally ran its course, and after a period of ensuing prosperity in the mid-twenties, the nation was once again plunged deeply into economic depression in 1929 only to be rescued economically by the Pearl Harbor bombing carried out by the Empire of Japan on December 7th of 1941.

What transpired in between was the greatest long-term severe episode of macro-economic malfunction in world history triggered by the 13% one-day drop in the Dow on October 28, 1929.

As an aside, the actual deepest one day drop on record was during the tail end of the Reagan administration on October 19, 1987 when the Dow dropped a whopping 22.6% in a single day!

After opening up still lower the next day, before noon ... "speculators" kicked in the purchase of index options that triggered the massive program traders of the day to once again re-enter the market to cover their short positions thus sparking the mild rally that ended the debacle quickly.

Not so in '29 ... the effect of THAT debacle lingered for decades creating a continued net decrement in consumer spending up until the engines of war cranked a super demand for labor once again.
